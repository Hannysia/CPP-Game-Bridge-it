# Bridge It - C++ Game

## Project Overview
This repository contains **Bridge It**, a turn-based puzzle game implemented in **C++** using **WinForms**. The game was developed as an **academic project**, focusing on interactive graphics and game logic using **GDI+** for rendering.

## Features
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: Players take turns placing bridges to create a connected path.
- **Custom Graphics Rendering**: The game is drawn using **WinForms' Graphics elements**, ensuring smooth visuals.
- **User Interaction**: Mouse-driven interactions for an intuitive gaming experience.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: AI opponent logic or multiplayer functionality (if applicable).

## Technologies Used
- **C++** with **WinForms**
- **GDI+** for rendering graphical elements
- **Event-driven programming** for handling player actions

## Project Structure
- **/src/** – Contains the main game logic and rendering code.
- **/assets/** – Stores game-related images or design elements.
- **/docs/** – Project documentation and resources.
- **README.md** – Project documentation.

## How to Play
1. Launch the game executable.
2. Players take turns placing bridges to connect islands.
3. The goal is to complete a path before the opponent.
